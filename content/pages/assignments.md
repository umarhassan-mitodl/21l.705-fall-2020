To encourage exploration of the linguistic richness of Middle English, you will do at least three “word-dives” in the *Middle English Dictionary* (MED). (You may also do more than three and submit your highest three grades.) Producing a strong final presentation will require grappling with linguistic complexity beyond what the marginal glosses and footnotes of our edition give you, so these word-dives offer practice in that.

This is based on the “noticing” exercise that I use in 21L.004, the CI-H subject Reading Poetry: not a formal essay, just an exercise. It is designed to assess and strengthen your abilities in close reading, and help you translate that skill to the linguistically unfamiliar Middle English.

Student-run mini-class and write-up thereof: 15%

In groups of two to four, depending on class size, each of you will be responsible for running one “mini-class” of approximately forty minutes. You should work with your group to submit a class plan ahead of time; after class, you will submit a brief, informal write-up of how things went, what you learned, and so on. You will be assessed on all three components. (I will also assess how actively and responsibly you participate in your peers’ mini-classes, but that will get folded into Attendance and Participation, below.)

Article/essay write-ups: 20%

As a CI-M subject, 21L.705 offers training in the forms of scholarly communication central to literary study. One of these is the literary-critical essay, so in addition to our primary text, the *Canterbury Tales*, we will read a good deal of so-called secondary literature that analyzes either the *Tales* themselves or some other aspect of medieval literary culture. For each of these secondary sources, you will complete a series of tasks: summarizing the central argument, looking up unfamiliar words and phrases, identifying one or more insights you gleaned from the essay, and formulating one or more questions you’d like to ask the author.

Final presentation: 20%

Another form of communication central to literary study is the so-called “20-minute conference paper.” Our scholarly conferences are generally organized around 90-minute panels with three speakers, each of whom presents for twenty minutes, followed by a thirty-minute discussion period in which an audience of fellow academics asks questions either of individual presenters or of the panel as a whole. Twenty minutes is generally enough time to present a short paper of about eight double-spaced pages, so that’s what you should aim to produce. Your arguments should be grounded in close reading, including grappling with the linguistic nuances of Middle English, as well as engagement with one or more secondary sources on your chosen text or topic: all skills you will have worked on in the assignments described above.
