## Assignment Description

Academic prose is a lot like Middle English, in that they are both recognizably versions of English as we know it, but with legions of substantial differences: unfamiliar vocabulary, complex and sometimes convoluted syntax, and probably others you could identify. Fortunately, like Middle English, academic prose becomes a lot easier to understand the more you work with it, and the tasks I’ve given you below offer a concrete way of doing so.

For each article or book chapter you read, choose 5–10 words whose meaning is unclear to you, whether because you are unfamiliar with the word itself or because it’s being used in an unfamiliar way. Look them up and choose which meaning seems most appropriate in context, then write it down—in effect creating a glossary of the article. That mini-glossary will form part of your homework post on the article. It is also good practice for life: actively discovering new meanings instead of passively watch the unfamiliar slide by.

Next, try to express the author’s most important argument in a single sentence. (It can be long and complex, but must be a recognizable sentence.) If appropriate, use two more sentences to express what you take to be the author’s next two most important points—but if you’re satisfied with your one-sentence summary, leave it there. Less is often more! You may not find it possible to pick a single idea as “most important,” but try: this intellectual labor will ensure that you’re grappling actively with the text instead of just letting its potentially difficult prose wash over you. Active vs. passive learning, my friends!!!

Then see if you can come up with one or more core insights—points that the author makes that you find illuminating or useful, or that otherwise stick with you and make you think, possibly reconsidering some of the priors you brought to the essay—as well as one or more questions that you would ask the author if they were available. This could be a request for clarification or expansion of a given point, or a question about how they might apply their arguments to a different text or author, or a “but what about this other thing”-type challenge ... anything else that’s intellectually substantive.

Finally—and this is very important—try to read with a spirit of intellectual humility and generosity: humility in that you assume, until definitively proven otherwise, that you can learn something from this author, even if you would not emulate their writing style or choose similar topics or reach similar conclusions; and generosity in that you seek to meet the author where they’re coming from, instead of using your own priors to dismiss a given mode of writing or line of argumentation prematurely.
