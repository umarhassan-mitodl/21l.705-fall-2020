## Assignment Description

Reread Chapter 1 of Horobin and think about the complexities that he describes of Middle English words like *nyce*, *fre*, and *trouthe*. What I am looking for from your Middle English word-dives is something similar to that, though on a smaller scale: an exploration of the range of meanings that a seemingly straightforward Middle English word in fact has, and some attempt to articulate the possible significance of that multiplicity of meanings to the Tales as a literary text.

In picking words to explore, you should not necessarily go first to those that are wholly obscure to you, especially if our edition gives them a concrete, seemingly straightforward meaning like *needle* or *cottage* (though even these might prove interesting). Abstract and metaphorical words, or those with a strong emotional charge (like *devour*, *sinister*, or *delight* in modern English), are likelier to have interesting, unexpected, or shifting meanings.

Above all, use the MED less like an ordinary dictionary—or rather not just like an ordinary dictionary—and more like a gateway onto ranges of meaning you would not otherwise have been aware of. It’s at least as much a research tool as an ordinary dictionary.

Each Middle English word-dive should consider three things:

1. The ***meanings*** of the word in question, including *when* those meanings date from (a meaning whose first occurrence is from 1450 might not have been available to Chaucer, who died in 1400. Comparably, a meaning last attested in 1325 may have been unavailable, or at least archaic, for Chaucer in the 1380s and 1390s. (Think about how dated words like *groovy* and *rad* feel now.)
2. The ***etymology*** of the word in question, including what language it seems to be from (Latin, French, Old English \[i.e., Germanic\], Old Norse, etc.) and what other words it is related to (as the word *seemly* is related to the verb to *seem*). Here you may wish to refer to the *Oxford English Dictionary*, which tends provide fuller etymologies than the MED.
3. The possible ***literary significance*** of this range of meanings. This is the hardest part since many examples of a given word are genuinely straightforward, even if the word had other available meanings or demonstrates interesting semantic change over time. You may also feel that you lack sufficient literary, linguistic, or historical context to make a truly persuasive argument. (That may be true now, but by the end of the semester, it won’t be!) Don’t be afraid to speculate; I will give credit to any reasonable rationale as to how the particularities of this word might matter to the text at hand. If it seems genuinely uninteresting, however, you should probably pick another word.

These exercises can be relatively brief—a few paragraphs, say—as long as they tackle each of    
the three tasks above.
