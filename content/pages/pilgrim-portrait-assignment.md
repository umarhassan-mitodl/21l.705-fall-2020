## Assignment Description

Your first assignment is to do a deep dive into one of the General Prologue portraits. The goal is threefold: to give you concrete ways of engaging closely with Middle English and so improve your comprehension of it; to serve as a diagnostic, allowing me to identify points of linguistic confusion or difficulty that I can try to clear up; and, finally, to hone/refresh/learn your skills in the kind of descriptive “close noticing” that prepares us for analytic close reading.

First, pick one of the following pilgrims: Clerk, Sergeant at Law, Franklin, Wife of Bath, or Reeve. (I’ve omitted pilgrims from the list above that we covered pretty thoroughly in class and those that didn’t seem like sufficiently fertile ground for this exercise.) Photocopy your chosen lines so that you can mark them up; you will submit this marked-up version (like the examples from my 21L.004 class) along with the exercise itself.

Then, translate the Middle English (ME) into modern English (ModE), making note of points that were confusing/difficult as well as those that seem either linguistically or tonally ambiguous/ambivalent. (There will likely be some overlap in these categories.) You may use any of the aids provided by our edition (marginal glosses and footnotes), as well as any Middle English dictionaries you turn up online or in the library (MED, Riverside glossary, etc.)—but NOT full translations into modern English, either published or posted online. The latter would both defeat the purpose of the exercise and constitute a violation of academic honesty.

On the basis of that translation, pick at least TWO Middle English words to research in the Middle English Dictionary (MED). By “research” I mean first puzzle out how to find the words you’re interested in—an exercise in itself, as we discussed in class! (remember, using \* as a wildcard for any and all vowels is incredibly helpful; if you’re stuck, use more \*’s!)—and then pore over the range of meanings those words could have had for Chaucer. Use the date ranges given in the list of quotations for each meaning as a rough gauge of whether Chaucer (1340ish-1400) would have had access to that particular sense of the word.

The point is to find interesting ranges of meaning, so you may need to explore more than two words to get satisfying results. Likely possibilities include words that seem to have an obvious ModE cognate, but to be used in unfamiliar or unexpected ways (remember the list of meanings of ME *sad* that I distributed in class); and/or places where the marginal gloss/footnote seems to be smoothing out ambiguities, collapsing multiple lexical potentialities into a single straightforward, potentially reductive meaning.

Then, start noticing stuff about the mechanics of Chaucer's language, and his rendering of language into iambic pentameter. Start with the list of “noticeable” aspects of poetic language laid out in the Description Assignment posted to Stellar, but think as well about Chaucer’s use of rhyme words, echoes of other pilgrim portraits, and the distinctive freedoms offered by Middle English word order. (Horobin’s material on vocabulary, style, and discourse will be helpful to refer back to here.) I’m not going to specify how many points you have to come up with, but don’t be satisfied just with the obviously low-hanging fruit. Work on noticing stuff for a solid 20-30 minutes, then give it a rest and come back to it later; you’ll probably see different things(or see the same things differently). You also don’t HAVE to stay exclusively at the level of description, as I asked my students to and as I tried to do in my own model that I wrote and distributed for them. It’s fine to take analytic notes as well, but you don’t have to.

Finally, write a set of 3-5 paragraphs—and these should be analytic—that reflect on what you learned from this exercise, and what challenges or questions remain. Possible topics include: Middle English as a language, poetic translation as a practice, Chaucer as a poet, the nature of your chosen pilgrim. This is not an exclusive list; you may address anything that seems fruitful to you.

This is a long list of difficult tasks, so you should expect to spend a goodly number of hours on this exercise. Good barometers of success: do your chosen lines, and the pilgrim they describe, seem more engaging, ironic, and/or ambivalent than when you first read them?; do you feel like you have a stronger sense of how Chaucer’s verse works, as a concrete set of linguistic and poetic practices?; have you noticed a lot of stuff (do you have a lot of data points) that you can imagine puzzling over further or asking more questions about or making arguments about?

I will grade rigorously, but don’t worry: the stakes are low because this exercise counts only 10% of your final grade. (It is numerically possible, for example, to get a C here but an A in the class.) In other words, take it seriously, work hard, and make it represent your best effort— diagnostics are useless otherwise—but do not stress out about the letter grade itself. And try to have fun!
